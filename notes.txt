In a non-React website, the typical flow involves the browser sending a request to the server, which in turn responds with an HTML page. When a user moves to a different page, the browser once again sends a request to the server, which responds by sending back the HTML page.

In React, the browser sends a single request to the server, and in response, the server provides an almost empty HTML page. Subsequently, React dynamically populates this page with the necessary content. When a user navigates to a different page, instead of sending a request to the server, the React router intercepts the request and injects the required content directly into the new page. This makes the website much faster and efficient.

To do this we need to install React router package. Use the following command to install:

    `npm install react-router-dom@${versionNumber}`, in this case we use version 5.
