A component is a self-contained section of content. For example a navbar is a component, a sidebar is a component, a footer is a component and so on.

A component has two parts:

    Template - This is the markup (The HTML part)

    Logic - This is how the component interacts with the user (The JavaScript package).


Right now we only have one component which is Script.jsx, in that component we have function called App (see Script.jsx ln 4). This function returns a code that looks like HTML but it is not. It is called JSX.

JSX allows us to create HTML-like code then a package called Babel transpiles it to HTML and renders it to the DOM.

The difference between JSX and HTML is that JSX uses className(carmelCase) to represent HTML classes

At the end of the component, we always export the component function so that we can use it in other files (see Script.jsx ln 25)
