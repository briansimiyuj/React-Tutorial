A custom hook is a reusable function that allows us to share logic between components, for example the logic we have created in useEffect hook. We can use it in other components like Home.

A hook must always start with the word 'use'.

We have created a custom hook called useFetch (useFetch.jsx) and transferred all the logic from Home component.

Let's now import it to Home component (Home.jsx ln 6).
