Controlled inputs helps us to set up input fields in a form so that we can track their values and store them in some state.

We have added a form with some inputs to the Create component to (Create.jsx ln15)

-useState hook creates title state variable to track user input.

value prop of the input element is connected to title to display current value in the input field (Create.jsx ln22).

onChange event triggers setTitle function to update title state with user input (Create.jsx ln23).

We do the same thing for body and author inputs.

Controlled inputs effectively manage form fields and user input in React.
