Currently when we click on page links, it still sends requests to the server for a new page and React Router is not intercepting them as mentioned earlier. To fix this, we need to use a special link tag.

Let's import the link tag in the NavBar component (NavBar.jsx ln 1). Then we replace the anchor tags with Link tags. Link tags have a "to" attribute just like the anchor tags have a "href" attribute (NavBar.jsx ln 14).

When we inspect the Link elements in the browser, they are shown as anchor tags. 

These Link tags are the ones that intercept the requests from going to the server and makes the website much faster.
