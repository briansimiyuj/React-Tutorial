Now let's go to the root component and import it (Script.jsx ln 5). Then surround the entire application with Router component (Script.jsx ln 11).

All the routes goes inside the Switch component (Script.jsx ln 19). We create a Route for each page in the application using the Router component.

In JSX, the Route element includes a path attribute that specifies the page link (Script.jsx ln21). We then proceed to nest the Home component within it.
