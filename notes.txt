Script.jsx is the root component of our project or application. This means it is the first component that gets rendered to the DOM and sits on top of the application.

If we were to create other components, they will be nested within Script.jsx. Also children components can have other components that will be nested within them. This makes up a component tree.

Let's create a navbar component (NavBar.jsx)

We will import the NavBar in Script.jsx

Then nest it in the App div as an element tag

We also do the same thing for the Home component
