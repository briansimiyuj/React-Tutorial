We retrieved the blogs from our mini database in the useEffect hook as shown in Home.jsx ln 22. We have to update the state with the new set of blogs (Home.jsx ln 34).

We cannot simply include the BlogList component within the home component without considering the current state (Home.jsx ln 45). This is because the blogs prop is currently null, which means we cannot iterate through it using the map method (BlogList.jsx ln 13). Therefore, we need to implement conditional templating on the BlogList component.
