React is a JavaScript library that allows us to create easily create Single Page Applications. This means a server needs to send a single page (let's say index.html) to the browser, and then React manages the whole website from the browser.

One can still navigate to other pages but those pages will be generated from the browser and not from the server. This makes things a lot easier and faster.

Install an extension called "Simple React Snippet" and enable emmet to work with React in vscode settings.
