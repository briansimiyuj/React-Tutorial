We have created a new component (Create.jsx) and nested it within a new Route with a path of '/create' (Home.jsx ln 31).

But when we navigate to the new path ('/create'), we see the same content that is in the Home component. This is because '/create' matches with '/' which is also the path to the Home component. To prevent this, we need to add the "exact" prop to the Route element of the Home component (Home.jsx ln 24). This means match this path if it's the exact url we navigate to.

Switch component makes sure only one route is shown in the browser at any given time.
