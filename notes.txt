useEffect is a hook that runs a set of code every time a component is rendered. It's more like a function (See Home.jsx ln27). Whenever we interact with the UI, useEffect runs.

We can also access states in useEffect but it is not recommended to change it since we could end up in endless loop of rendering. 

Sometimes we may not want to run a function after every single render, but only after a specific render. To do that, we need to use a dependancy array.

We use dependancy array as a second argument in the useEffect function (See Home.jsx ln33). In the example, the empty array makes sure useEffect only runs once(the first render).

Now we have a dependancy array that has an item (name). Therefore useEffect will run after the first render and only when the name changes. Thus name is a dependancy (see Home.jsx ln36).
