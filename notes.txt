Most of the time we won't have the state we need in our React application like the one we created for blogs. So we have to fetch it from a database.

Let's create a mini database (./database/database.json). We will then watch the database using a JSON server. Use the following command to run JSON server:

    `npx json-server --watch ${databaseDirectory/databaseFile.json} --port ${portNumber}`.

JSON server wraps the database with API end points which are:

    i. /blogs  GET                This fetches all blogs.
    ii. /blogs/{id}  GET          This fetches a single blog.
    iii. /blogs/   POST           This adds a new blog.
    iv. /blogs/{id} DELETE        This deletes a blog.
