Sometimes we need to pass dynamic values as a part of a Route. We call these dynamic values as Route Parameters. We have created a BlogDetails component (BlogDetails.jsx) and we have setup a Route for it in Script.jsx ln40. The Route path is "/blog/:id". The 'id is the Route parameter.

useParams (BlogDetails.jsx ln5) hook helps us grab parameters from the route.
