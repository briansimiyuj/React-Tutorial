To get started with React, we use a CLI tool called Create React App. In order to use it, we need to have the latest version of node js installed.

This Create React App tool will generate all the necessary files and directories that are needed to run React. Use the following command:

    `npx create-react-app ${project-name}`

In this case we have created a project called dojo-blog in our root directory.
